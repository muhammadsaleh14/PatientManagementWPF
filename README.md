# Patient Management System in WPF 
This project is made using WPF, a .NET framework
MVVM architecture

**Technologies Used**
- Material design
- .NET core for database manipulation

**Features:**
 - Save patient data (visits, chronic details, diagnosis details, visit details)
 - Auto save
 - Disable and enable diagnosis details for different doctors
 - Sort diagnosis detail by priority
 - Autocomplete

**Extra:**
Before this I had implemented the same idea in Next.js but the code was very messy and I couldn't package the Next.js app into a desktop app so I implemented the same idea using WPF, which is for windows desktop applications.
